# Variant-Calling-Pipeline-for-DNA-Seq
An automated Bash pipeline for prokaryotic variant calling. It streamlines the workflow from raw SRA data to annotated VCFs, incorporating QC (fastp), mapping (BWA), and variant detection (bcftools). Designed for high-throughput genomic analysis and functional annotation of SNPs/Indels in any bacterial research context.
